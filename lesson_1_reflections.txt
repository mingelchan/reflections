How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I can concentrate on these differences and think about the results caused by each one of them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

In many circumstances, when bugs appear, restarting from the last version takes less efforts than editing in the current one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros of manually choosing is that I can add a short message to clearly record the logical changes which help a lot when reviewing different versions, but having versions automatically saved will result in too many versions meaningless which maybe even more disturbing.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Multiple files management is especially required by programmers, who are the target users of Git, while systems like Google Docs only concentrate on normal users who just need a tool providing online editing and saving functionality for single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
